YubiKey NEO App: OpenPGP
========================

This project implement the OpenPGP card functionality used on the
YubiKey NEO device that is sold by Yubico.

This project is based on the "Java Card OpenPGP Card" project made by
Joeri de Ruiter.  The initial modifications we have made compared to
the upstream project are minor, but we reserve the right to make other
changes and improvements that are specific to the YubiKey NEO
hardware.  For the original project homepage, see:
http://sourceforge.net/p/javacardopenpgp/

The upstream project was released under the GPLv2+ and our fork uses

Building
--------

See doc/Building.txt for information on how to build the source code
and doc/InstallCAPFile.txt on how to install it.
