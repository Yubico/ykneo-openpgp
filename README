but not on newer Yubico products. No development is happening on this.

[IMPORTANT]

Yubico has learned of a security issue with the OpenPGP Card applet project that is used in the YubiKey NEO. This vulnerability applies to you only if you are using OpenPGP, and you have the OpenPGP applet version 1.0.9 or earlier.

This project implement the OpenPGP card functionality used on the
YubiKey NEO device that is sold by Yubico.

This project is based on the 
https://github.com/jderuiter/javacard-openpgpcard[Java Card OpenPGP Card]
project made by Joeri de Ruiter. 
The initial modifications we have made compared to
the upstream project are minor, but we reserve the right to make other
changes and improvements that are specific to the YubiKey NEO
hardware.

=== Building

See doc/Building.txt for information on how to build the source code
and doc/InstallCAPFile.txt on how to install it.
