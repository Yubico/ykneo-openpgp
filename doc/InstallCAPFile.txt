Installing CAP file on YubiKey NEO
----------------------------------

After building the CAP file you can install it on a NEO.  You need to
have a NEO with default card manager keys, or know the card manager
keys.

Enable CCID mode on the NEO
---------------------------

First make sure the YubiKey NEO is in the HID/CCID or CCID mode.  You
may use the YubiKey NEO Manager GUI:
https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-neo-manager/

If you prefer command line tools, you may use the 'ykpers' and
'ykneomgr' tools depending on which mode the YubiKey NEO is in.  See:
https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-personalization/
https://developers.yubico.com/libykneomgr/

Refer to the documentation of these projects on how to mode switch the
YubiKey NEO.

Installing CAP file to NEO
--------------------------

Install the gpshell tool from Global Platform:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/globalplatform/

We have tested the combination of GlobalPlatform Library version
6.0.0, GPShell version 1.4.4, and gppcscconnectionplugin version
1.1.0.

You need to whitelist the device in /etc/libccid_Info.plist which
happens automatically if you have a recent libccid.

WARNING!  When you load a new CAP file, everything on the device for
that app is erased.  Keep a backup of your credentials.

When the CAP file has been built and is available in the default path,
you may use the gpshell tool to load it:

  $ gpshell gpinstall.txt

You can modify the gpinstall.txt file if you have other card manager
keys.  To set a proper OpenPGP card serial number you need to use the
parameter -instAID so in gpinstall.txt replace this line:

...
install -file ./applet/bin/openpgpcard/javacard/openpgpcard.cap -instParam 00 -priv 00
...

with the following after replacing xxxxxxxx with the serial number you
want.  Note that YubiKey NEOs have decimal serial numbers.  You can
convert that into hex and put it in the Application ID.  However,
GnuPG will sometimes query you to insert "Card xxxxxxxx" and if you
used xxxxxxxx as the hex representation of your decimal serial number,
it may be difficult locating the right NEO (if you have multiple).
Thus, we recommend to store the serial number in BCD code so if your
YubiKey NEO has serial number 4711 you would use xxxxxxxx=00004711.

...
install -instAID D2760001240102000006xxxxxxxx0000 file ./applet/bin/openpgpcard/javacard/openpgpcard.cap -instParam 00 -priv 00
...


That's it!
