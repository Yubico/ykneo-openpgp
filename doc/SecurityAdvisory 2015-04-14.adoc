Security Advisory for ykneo-openpgp
===================================

Tracking IDs: YSA-2015-1 and CVE-2015-3298.

Background
----------

The YubiKey NEO is a flexible security product from Yubico that
implements the Yubico One-Time Password technology, FIDO Universal 2nd
Factor, OATH codes, PIV card, and OpenPGP card functionality.  The
on-card OpenPGP software of the YubiKey NEO is implemented by the free
and open-source software (FOSS) project "ykneo-openpgp", forked from
an earlier implementation called “javacardopenpgp”.

Summary
-------

The source code contains a logical flaw related to user
PIN (aka PW1) verification that allows an attacker with local host privileges
and/or physical proximity (NFC) to perform security operations without
knowledge of the user's PIN code.

Mitigation
----------

The flaw is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would typically
require some abilities that would enable the attack even without the
logical flaw.

In particular, any attacker with access to the local host must be
assumed to be able to learn the user's PIN code, simply by
intercepting communication with the OpenPGP card hardware or through
key logging.

Alternatively, if the attacker has physical proximity to the card, it
could wait for the device to be used normally over NFC and then learn
the PIN code wirelessly and perform the attack at a later point.

If your device is stolen, attackers may use it to perform private-key
operations.  If an attacker has gone through the trouble of obtaining
physical access to a key, the conservative approach is to regard it is
possible that the attacker were able to learn the PIN earlier since the
PIN is often unprotected.  In situations like this, you should treat the
key as potentially compromised and revoke the key.

Generally the OpenPGP Card specification does not protect against
private key-usage by malware and/or PIN phishing, and any OpenPGP Card
implementation is vulnerable to similar attacks.

Note that the private key is not at jeopardy, and malware cannot learn
the private key -- this is in fact the primary threat that the
OpenPGP card specification protects against.

Analysis
--------

The following description is courtesy of Joey Castillo.

The bug appears to be a typo in the first line of the
computeDigitalSignature, decipher and internalAuthenticate
methods. The goal of each is to establish that the PW1 has been
validated, AND the proper mode has been set (mode 81 for signing, mode
82 for everything else). According to the spec, if either of these
conditions are not satisfied, the security operation should not
proceed.

The application mangles this a bit, as you can see in line 628:

https://github.com/Yubico/ykneo-openpgp/blob/f82f3e4dc80e4476e90411bc837c52d6e1c9355f/applet/src/openpgpcard/OpenPGPApplet.java#L628

 if (!pw1.isValidated() && pw1_modes[PW1_MODE_NO81])
     ISOException.throwIt(SW_SECURITY_STATUS_NOT_SATISFIED);
 // otherwise execution continues

This truth table shows the outcome of the conditional, and the two
cases where the logic fails:

[options="header"]
|==================================================================
|Case | PIN valid | Mode 81 | !(PIN valid) | Result | Outcome
|  1  | true      | true    | false        | false  | No exception
|  2  | false     | true    | true         | true   | Exception thrown
|  3  | true      | false   | false        | false  | No exception (Incorrect)
|  4  | false     | false   | true         | false  | No exception (Incorrect)
|==================================================================

I discovered this bug due to case #3: OpenKeychain for Android
mistakenly verifies the PIN with mode 82 for signing, which should not
allow a signature to be generated. The Yubikey generates a signature
anyway.

The dire case is #4: when the card is powered up, the PIN has not been
validated, and both modes are set to false. In this state, the card
will issue a signature even though the PIN has not been validated. The
same bug is present in the decipher command (line 659) and the
internalAuthenticate command (line 683), just with the mode set to
82. This means the card will also decrypt session keys and
authenticate challenges unconditionally.

https://github.com/Yubico/ykneo-openpgp/blob/f82f3e4dc80e4476e90411bc837c52d6e1c9355f/applet/src/openpgpcard/OpenPGPApplet.java#L683

Solution
--------

This is also courtesy of Joey Castillo.

The fix is to change each of the conditionals to the following:

 if (!pw1.isValidated() || !pw1_modes[PW1_MODE_NO8x])
     ISOException.throwIt(SW_SECURITY_STATUS_NOT_SATISFIED);
 // otherwise execution continues

This way, if the PIN has not been validated, OR the proper mode has
not been set, an exception is thrown. Execution is only allowed to
continue if both conditions are true.

This fix has been integrated into ykneo-openpgp and is part of the
version 1.0.9 release, but read on for some information about 1.0.10.

How to check if you are affected
--------------------------------

Versions below 1.0.9 are affected by this problem.  Unfortunately,
some YubiKey NEOs shipped with a 1.0.9 release that did not contain
the fix.  To simplify version checking, we have released 1.0.10 and
NEOs using that version is known to always include the fix.  To be
certain that your NEO has the fixed ykneo-openpgp applet installed,
look for a version of 1.0.10 or later.

You may check the applet version with the following command.

....
 $ gpg-connect-agent --hex "scd apdu 00 f1 00 00" /bye
 D[0000]  01 00 06 90 00                                     .....
 OK
....

The string "01 00 06" means version 1.0.6, which would be affected by
this problem.

Recommendation
--------------

The logical flaw is real and violates assumption of how the OpenPGP
applet works in principle.  However its practical consequences are
relatively small as a successful attack requires other privileged
operations (such as local root access) that are normally not available
to an attacker, and would have undermined the security anyway.

*Regardless of this assessment, Yubico has decided to replace YubiKey NEO keys for those who are using the OpenPGP applet version 1.0.9 or earlier. This replacement program began on April 26, 2015.

Therefore, we don't see any immediate need for users to upgrade existing
deployed products.  We will incorporate the improved code in future
products sold, and add self-tests to our software project to detect any
regression in this area.

For stolen devices, we continue to recommend users to follow best-practices
and revoke the key as a conservative measure.

As we take all security related incidents seriously we have prepared a
prompt security advisory and released all information about this
incident that we know about.  We welcome further analysis of the
source code, as this will over time increase confidence in the
product, and is the reason the source is available.

If you have additional inquiries related to your YubiKey NEO purchase,
please contact your sales contact for further discussion.
